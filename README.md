The Expense Tracker web application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Adobe Photoshop for graphic design and Visual Studio Code as the development environment. It provides users with a simple and efficient way to track and manage their expenses. HTML was used for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Adobe Photoshop helped create appealing visuals, and Visual Studio Code facilitated the coding process.
